                        Three sets of kitchen odds-and-ends, bought and sold:

                        The hall is a place to wait in,
                    </p>
                    <p>Caught in my first California downpour, I take refuge in Oakland’s Chapel of Chimes. The pillared entrance opens onto a marble hallway. Palm trees and glass walls. Pieces of a greenhouse scattered. Exotic plants everywhere: bougainvillea and vertical boxes  lled with succulents.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    The main hallway opens onto more narrow paths sequen- tially. These too branch off with increasing disorder through the building’s labyrinthine structure. The further along an artery you travel, the more intimate the space becomes—the more private. Following my feet through the in nite and unforeseen I have found it. This quiet corner, this moment, completely mine.
